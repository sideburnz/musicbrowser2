                I've put a new version of MusicBrowser 2 onto <a href="http://code.google.com/p/musicbrowser2/downloads/list">GoogleCode</a> today, 2.4.0.1. This 
                version is identical code-wise to 2.4.0.0 so if you're not having any issues with that version there's no need to install the new version.
                </p>
                <p>
                What has changed is the installer, to address an issue where the code didn't have the correct permissions to put the Sqlite DLLs where they needed to 
                be, I've made the installer put the file in the right place. The reason it didn't do this previously was because 32bit and 64bit Windows needed different
                versions of the DLL. This means I've had to create seperate 32bit and 64bit installers.
                </p>
